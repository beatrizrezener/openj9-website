OpenJDK builds that contain Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.19.0 are now available from the AdoptOpenJDK community project:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk14&#x26;jvmVariant=openj9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenJDK version 14</a></p>\n<p>As well as providing support for the latest release of OpenJDK, here are some of the new features and other changes that we've introduced in version 0.19.0 of OpenJ9.</p>\n<p>Do let us know how well these work for you by posting in our <a href=\"https://openj9.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNDU4MDI4Mjk0MTk2LWVhNTMzMGY1N2JkODQ1OWE0NTNmZjM4ZDcxOTBiMjk3NGFjM2U0ZDNhMmY0MDZlNzU0ZjAyNzQ1ODlmYjg3MjA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">slack workspace</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There are a number of performance improvements in this releases, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 10% better application rampup on multi-CPU systems due to the invocation count threshold being lowered for JIT compilation, when shared classes are not in use.</li>\n<li>Improvements to the class relationship verifier (originally released in version 0.17.0) with shared classes have seen a doubling of the performance benefit from the option <em>-XX:+ClassRelationshipVerifier</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A new command line option, <em>-XX:+PrintCodeCache</em>, allows you to print the code cache memory usage to stderr when the VM shuts down.</li>\n<li>A 1 G <em>char[]</em> or larger <em>StringBuffer</em> and <em>StringBuilder</em> now immediately grows to the maximum possible size for <em>all</em> current versions of Java, including OpenJDK 8. For OpenJDK 8 only, you can revert to the previous behavior of growing only as much as necessary to accommodate the <em>String</em> being added, by using the option <em>-Djava.lang.stringBuffer.growAggressively=false</em>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>jpackage</strong> utility is described in JEP 343 as a tool that \"packages a Java application into a platform-specific package that includes all of the necessary dependencies.\" Full details of the tool are available at <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">JEP 343: Packaging Tool</a> Be aware that <strong>jpackage</strong> is supported on only the following OpenJ9 platforms: Linux®, macOS®, and Windows™. It is <em>not</em> supported on AIX® or z/OS® platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To read more about the changes in version 0.19.0, see the <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/version0.19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Release notes</a> in the OpenJ9 user documentation, which will also give you detailed information about the options mentioned here.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
